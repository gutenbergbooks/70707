<p>Those authors and subjects that many
readers are glad to come at in a brief
way, (and who may be thereby quickened to
direct their studies anew to the sometimes
surface hidden beauties of literature,) will continue
to find ample presentation in <i>The Bibelot</i>
for 1896.</p>

<p>The typework that has made so many
friends among bookmen, will also be fully
sustained; in a word, <i>The Bibelot</i> still proposes
to remain something quite by itself, and out
of the highway and beaten track of every-day
book-making.</p>

<p>Subscriptions for 1896 at the regular
price, 50 cents in advance, postpaid, are
taken for the complete year only. After
March 1, the rate will be 75 cents, which will,
on completion of Volume II, be advanced to
$1.00 net.</p>

<p>It is desirable that <span class="smcap">renewals for 1896</span>
should be forwarded Mr. Mosher <i>early</i> that
no vexatious delays may occur in mailing.

and end with December of each year.</p>

But there is room enough in the Literary Show for a

<p>The <i>Fly Leaf</i> is filled with Wit and Personality,

<p>The <i>Fly Leaf</i> is the most unexpected and amusing

and it does not aim to be Cheap, but Clever.
It interests all who are smart enough to recognize
“a good thing” at sight. It is written with Individuality

<p class="dropcap">An Italian kept a fruit stand on a corner where
he had good aim at the people who came
down from the elevated station and at those who
went along two thronged streets. He sat most of
the day in a backless chair that was placed strategically.</p>

<p>There was a babe living hard by, up five flights of
stairs, who regarded this Italian as a tremendous
being. The babe had investigated this fruit stand.
It had thrilled him as few things he had met with in
his travels had thrilled him. The sweets of the world
laid there in dazzling rows, tumbled in luxurious
heaps. When he gazed at this Italian seated amid
such splendid treasure, his lower lip hung low and
his eyes raised to the vendor’s face were filled with
deep respect, worship, as if he saw omnipotence.</p>

<p>The babe came often to this corner. He hovered
about the stand and watched each detail of the business.
He was fascinated by the tranquility of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
vendor, the majesty of power and possession. At
times, he was so engrossed in his contemplation that
people, hurrying, had to use care to avoid bumping
him down.</p>

<p>He had never ventured very near to the stand.
It was his habit to hang warily about the curb. Even
there he resembled a babe who looks unbidden at
a feast of gods.</p>

<p>One day, however, as the baby was thus staring,
the vendor arose and going along the front of the
stand, began to polish oranges with a red pocket-handkerchief.
The breathless spectator moved across
the sidewalk until his small face almost touched the
vendor’s sleeve. His fingers were gripped in a fold
of his dress.</p>

<p>At last, the Italian finished with the oranges and
returned to his chair. He drew a newspaper printed
in his language from behind a bunch of bananas.
He settled himself in a comfortable position and
began to glare savagely at the print. The babe was
left face to face with the massed joys of the world.</p>

<p>For a time he was a simple worshipper at this
golden shrine. Then tumultuous desires began to
shake him. His dreams were of conquest. His lips
moved. Presently into his head there came a little
plan.</p>

<p>He sidled nearer, throwing swift and cunning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
glances at the Italian. He strove to maintain his
conventional manner, but the whole plot was written
upon his countenance.</p>

<p>At last he had come near enough to touch the
fruit. From the tattered skirt came slowly his small
dirty hand. His eyes were still fixed upon the vendor.
His features were set, save for the under lip,
which had a faint fluttering movement. The hand
went forward.</p>

<p>Elevated trains thundered to the station and the
stairway poured people upon the sidewalks. There
was a deep sea roar from feet and wheels going
ceaselessly. None seemed to perceive the babe engaged
in the great venture.</p>

<p>The Italian turned his paper. Sudden panic smote
the babe. His hand dropped and he gave vent to a
cry of dismay. He remained for a moment staring
at the vendor. There was evidently a great debate
in his mind. His infant intellect had defined the
Italian. The latter was undoubtedly a man who
would eat babes that provoked him. And the alarm
in him when the vendor had turned his newspaper
brought vividly before him the consequences if he
were detected.</p>

<p>But at this moment, the vendor gave a blissful
grunt and tilting his chair against a wall, closed his
eyes. His paper dropped unheeded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span></p>

<p>The babe ceased his scrutiny and again raised his
hand. It was moved with supreme caution toward
the fruit. The fingers were bent, claw-like, in the
manner of great heart-shaking greed.</p>

<p>Once he stopped and chattered convulsively because
the vendor moved in his sleep. The babe with
his eyes still upon the Italian again put forth his hand
and the rapacious fingers closed over a round bulb.</p>

<p>And it was written that the Italian should at this
moment open his eyes. He glared at the babe a
fierce question. Thereupon the babe thrust the
round bulb behind him and with a face expressive of
the deepest guilt, began a wild but elaborate series
of gestures declaring his innocence.</p>

<p>The Italian howled. He sprang to his feet, and
with three steps overtook the babe. He whirled him
fiercely and took from the little fingers a lemon.</p>

<p class="dropcap">An article in a late number of <span class="smcap">The Philistine</span>
names Organized Charity as <i>The Kind
that Paul Forgot</i>. Such an aspersion on a saint’s
memory is itself uncharitable. If Paul knew his
Bible he did not forget the injunction of the Old
Testament: “I was a Father to the poor, and the
cause which I knew not I searched out;” and Paul
said himself to the Thessalonians: “If any man will
not work neither shall he eat.” These precepts
state two root principles of charity organization—information
before reformation, and a flat denial of
alms to the indolent. To deny their truth would imply
a “Philistinism” of the obnoxious kind that Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
Arnold had in mind when he said: “Philistine
gives the notion of something particularly stiff-necked
and perverse in its resistance to light.” Even
Paul, by the way, was once such a Philistine, but we
read that as he journeyed towards Damascus a great
light shone around him and he became a new man.</p>

<p>“When letters of appeal to the newspapers are
sent to a board of review,” our critic says, “impulse
will be put in cold storage.” Possibly, but it would
no longer be easier for people to work the newspapers
than to work themselves. “Catalogue poverty,”
he says, “quiz it, register it, dub it Case One;
let hunger wait for an investigation, and if a bar
sinister appears anywhere, deny food and shelter.”
The last sentence could never have been written if
its author had made some preliminary inquiries such
as modern charity requires. The invariable rule of
true charity is to relieve urgent distress instantly, and
to forgive errors seventy times seven even, with a
sympathy which never grows callous, if there is still
a chance of helping. Paradoxical as it may seem,
money is not a panacea for poverty. If drink has
made a man poor, money will feed not him but his
drunkenness. If improvidence is his fault, free
lodging, free food, free clothes, or even work found
ready-made, will only foster his improvidence.
There are so-called charitable institutions which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
spend huge sums in gathering about them colonies of
thriftless, indolent loafers, whose only hope of regeneration
lies in the very spur of hunger which devoted
men and women are laboring night and day to
remove. It is “moral murder” to teach the poor
that drunkenness, indolence and improvidence will
be toled along and that a “poor face” will draw
doles. To interfere lightly with the severe laws of
Nature is to assume a grave responsibility. “Suppose
the Father of us all did administer His beneficence
on such a plan?” says our critic. Are we
sure he does not?</p>

<p>Pauperism is a disease, and requires more skilled
treatment and less amateur dosing. Only the most
unregenerate complain of the hospitals because they
catalogue sickness, register it, quiz it, dub it Case
One, or even let suffering wait for an investigation,
and refuse to administer soothing drugs which, <i>like
alms</i>, give a temporary relief without curing, and are
apt to create an appetite which is more harmful than
the pain which they relieve.</p>

<p>The Moses has not yet appeared who shall lead
the suffering masses out of the bondage of poverty,
and we know not even which road he will go, but
perhaps the smoothest way and the nearest way is
not the one which will prevent backsliding. “And
it came to pass that God led them out, not through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
the way of the Philistines, although that was near;
for God said, Lest peradventure they return to
Egypt, but God led the people about through the
way of the wilderness of the Red Sea.”</p>

<p class="dropcap">Sunset hour at the meridian of Paradise Flats:
but no sunset was visible. It was the worse
end of a bad December day. Out doors, all was one
color, and the rain froze as it fell.</p>

<p>Before the big tenement stood a Russian sleigh,
with an impatient pair of clipped chestnuts. A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
Roman sentinel in furs sat on the box, and his liveried
mate groped in the dark hall for the habitat of John
Jones, who had been “recommended.” John Jones
lived there, but there was no evidence of it on the first
floor. This tenement was not provided with a hall
directory and a battery of bells. Poverty makes residence
uncertain from month to month. Many a
good man has been returned “not found” or “a
fake,” because he had to try elsewhere when the
rent came due.</p>

<p>On the fifth floor, a room that looked back over a
net of railroads held John Jones’s treasures. Three
little girls were keeping the stove warm. There was
some coal in it, but the way it acted was proof that
warmth is not always provoked by poking. The fire
had a hungry look like the children, and like them,
moreover, evinced an anxious desire to go out,
cheerless as it was beyond the ineffective screen of
the walls. The footman’s knock created a flutter in
the little group. Who would knock at that door?</p>

<p>“It’s a p’liceman,” suggested little four-year-old
Kit. The coal in the stove and a grape basketful
more had been picked up on the tracks.</p>

<p>Hand-in-hand they lined up at the door and eight-year-old
Annie opened it. Kit and the two-year-old
pulled hard on the line when the towering footman
entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span></p>

<p>“Does John Jones live here?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the eldest girl.</p>

<p>“John Jones, who registered at the Work and
Aid Bureau?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” said the girl, cautiously.</p>

<p>“Sure!” put in the four-year-old.</p>

<p>“Where is he?”</p>

<p>“He’s out looking for some work, sir.”</p>

<p>John was a mechanic until over-production or
under-distribution or something else turned everything
upside down. Now he was looking for work
of any kind—and not finding it.</p>

<p>“Where’s your mother?”</p>

<p>“She’s sick in bed, sir,” said Annie.</p>

<p>“Say, mister! Do you know what we’ve got?”
piped the four-year-old. “We’ve got a new baby,
and it’s a boy!”</p>

<p>A grunt of disgust was the lackey’s only answer.
Well, what then? If John Jones had work, or a
little money in the bank, it would be no reproach to
him that the miracle of life had been wrought once
more over in the corner of that room, and that there
was one more mouth to feed. But this wasn’t business.</p>

<p>“Can you write?” the footman said to the girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, a little,” she said.</p>

<p>“Write your name here,” he said, producing a
receipt book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span></p>

<p>The girl made a scratch where he indicated, with
some tremor. Then he handed her a large package
which he had held in his gloved hand. “This is for
your father,” he said; “don’t open it until he
comes,” and the vision of furry magnificence faded
from sight.</p>

<p>John Jones, coming up the narrow stair, was almost
crowded down again by the swelling cape of the man
who was looking for him, passing down. Of course
neither knew the other. A moment later the father
with a heavy countenance entered the back room and
asked in an anxious whisper how mamma was. Before
the elder girl could answer the younger cried out,
“O Papa! there was a splendid man here for you
and he brought you somefing nice.”</p>

<p>The square package was a problem to the man.
So large and so light. When it was opened the puzzle
was no less. It was a picture—a beautiful
woman’s head, with a pensive, tender look that
might have been the Sphynx’s own schoolmarm
stare for all it meant to him. As he looked for an
explanatory mark somewhere a card dropped to the
floor. This is what he read on it:</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Yes, most potent seignors, a complaint! Persuade
me not; I will make a star chamber
matter of it.</p>

<p>Which of us—humble and much enduring devotees
of the Muse—having somehow got our song or
sonnet accepted and in the course of years published,
has not waxed wroth to find it mischievously meddled
with, the trail of the editor’s blue pencil over all its
printed lines?</p>

<p>In prose editorial interference is exasperating
enough. But in verse, where a comma misplaced,
arbitrarily inserted or omitted, may change the whole
meaning or effect of a pet phrase! And when the
editor comes to manipulating words instead of punctuation
marks, and juggling with rhymes even and
with titles, what is to be said? What the author
commonly says cannot be printed here.</p>

<p>I once knew a poetaster who wrote a handful of
little rhymes which he called rather happily after his
own notion, “Songs of a Year,” and which in due<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
time appeared in print. The editor, however, had
thought “The Four Seasons” a more taking title.
The poetaster disagreed with him, but it was too
late. Another effort of this same unfortunate he protested
tearfully that he could not recognize in its
printed form except by the strawberry mark, that is,
the signature; and he said he wished the editor
had revised that, too, while he was about it.</p>

<p>What is an editor? Is he omniscient? We know
better. Are all the articles in his magazine supposed
to bear the imprint of his ideas and style? When
Mr. Howells, at an alleged salary of fifteen thousand
a year, edited the <i>Cosmopolitan</i> and wrote most of it
himself—well, you remember.</p>

<p>If the editor knows to a comma how he wants his
poetry written, let him write it himself, as Mr. Gilder
mostly does. If he thinks he can improve on the
poetical style of his contributor and wants to put in
his time that way, let him write and propose collaboration,
or at least submit to the poor mortal of an
author a plan of the contemplated improvements.
But to go ahead on his own hook and change the
whole complexion of the thing perhaps, and then
send it out over the original signature? It is not
honest.</p>

<p>The author relinquishes for a time the child of his
brain, fondly expecting to get it back again in beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
new clothes of type. What he does get is a
changeling with dyed hair and a clothespin on its
nose. Is he grateful? Hardly.</p>

<p>When the editor accepts a drawing for his magazine
does he proceed to work it over, put in a few
more shadows, touch up the high lights and perhaps
alter the arrangement of the model’s back hair?
Not as a rule.</p>

<p>A magazine is not a school for drawing, nor is it a
literary kindergarten. An editor is not a pedagogue.</p>

<p>If he thinks a thing good enough to print, let him
print it honestly as it was made; if not, let him return
it with thanks and encourage the author to send
it somewhere else. That author, if he is worth his
Attic salt, would rather have his verses printed in the
Podunk <i>Thinker</i> as he wrote them than in the <i>Century</i>
with R. W. Gilder’s emendations.</p>

<p class="dropcap">When Abiel Whitworth went to the assessor’s
office to get fifty per cent. taken from the taxable
value of his house and lot, he stepped jauntily
into the room. Then he shuddered. “I want to
see the assessor,” he faltered.</p>

<p>Now, the man who had lifted his head when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
stepped on the rug before the official desk filled him
with a vague alarm. He was of only medium size,
not well put together: he had a curling black mustache,
a heavy, monkey-like face, a miraculously
clean shave, a political diamond in his shirt, new
clothes and an air of brutal leisure that reminded one
of a sphinx, or an alderman. But it was the shining,
glassy, far seeing eye, with its lashes turned back,
that startled Mr. Whitworth. It was so cold, so
empty of expression, so thoroughly uncanny, that it
scared him. After a long, searching look, in which
he did not seem to breathe, the assessor bent his head
and resumed the study of a paper that lay on the
desk before him.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitworth waited; a clock ticked and buzzed
somewhere in the room, emphasizing the silence: then
he gulped and repeated, “I want to see Mr. Flannery,
the assessor.”</p>

<p>Some seconds elapsed this time before the man at
the desk raised his head again and transfixed him
with another stare: then he resumed his reading.
The man was wrong, in some way. Was he mad?
He might be a vampire, or a ghoul, for he did not
look or act like a human being. Mr. Whitworth became
quite chilly in his blood.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I want to see the assessor,” he
said, huskily, and was about to turn away and run,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
when a solitary clerk, who had been toiling over a
ledger in the back of the room, hastened forward
and said, “Beg pardon, sir, but I was in the middle
of a calculation and wanted to finish it. Can I do
anything for you?”</p>

<p>“I wanted to see Mr. Flannery.”</p>

<p>“This represents Mr. Flannery,” said the clerk,
“and represents him remarkably well, in more than
one way. He is, if I may so call him, the official
Mr. Flannery.”</p>

<p>“I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I dare say not. We don’t let everybody know
about it.” And, calmly lifting Mr. Flannery’s head
from his shoulders, the clerk reached down his neck
and adjusted something inside of him. The sound of
the clock stopped, and Mr. Flannery did not lift his
head again after it was replaced.</p>

<p>Mr. Whitworth gasped.</p>

<p>“You see, sir,” added the clerk, “Mr. Flannery
was appointed by Mayor Rourke, at the request of
Boss McManus. It was supposed that he could read
and write, for he has been quite successful in managing
primary elections, and has made a good lot of
money in the saloon business. But he can’t read
and he is busy, so what was the use in his coming to
the office? He had this wax figure of himself made
to sit at this desk, and there is a spring attachment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
that works whenever anyone stands on that rug.
The figure, you see, lifts its head once in twenty
seconds, and that is all that Flannery does when he
is here. The taxpayers have been kicking so hard
about absentees that the boss and others have been
stirring the office holders up and Flannery thinks it’s
only right to make this much of a concession. Very
few find out that it is not Flannery, except that he
swears more. If you want to see the sure enough
Flannery go down to his saloon on Columbus avenue.
He comes here every second Saturday—he is very
good about that—to get his pay.”</p>

freely.”</p>

myself, under the new mayor.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> The drama is queer. Life’s queer, for that matter,
but queerness does most abound when Mr.
Mansfield gives up elevating the stage and begins
hoisting the lecture platform—or doesn’t, whichever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
is the latest news. Mansfield can earn some hundreds
a week acting; wants to make it thousands,
managing; fails, naturally, not having a spreadeagle
mustache and sufficient capacity for the tender passion;
abuses people for not supporting Art. Mansfield
reminds the irreverent reader of Jno. Glimmer
Screed, bewailing in the <i>Forum</i> that he can only
make five thousand dollars a year by his puissant pen
and that his children must eat breadless butter or butterless
bread, or other incomplete dietary, and live in
a flat. These considerations suggest a legislative
enactment of the “be and hereby is” sort, assessing
upon the taxpayers the cost of paying fifty thousand
dollars a year each to all people who are so lacking
in the sense of humor as to suppose it makes any
difference whether they eat bread or snow.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> The drama isn’t queerer than literature. Laureate
Austin, mere mention of whose name has been
known to split a horse’s sides, dedicates <i>England’s
Darling</i> to the Princess of Wales by permission. No
knowing whether the darling is the Princess or the
Laureate without reading the verses, and that’s too
much trouble.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> Mr. Moulting Storrs Bigelow has lost the tail
feathers of his prestige in the insurance business,
which than his requires cheek even more adamantine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> Mr. Richard Harding Davis is being congratulated
upon his “manly words about the Monroe doctrine,”
wherewith the fifteen dollar a week hired-man-of-intellect
in the Harper factory saved his fifteen
thousand dollars a year article upon Venezuela from
being quite so idiotic as it might have been. Dr.
Conan Doyle prescribes peace with Great Britain to
Uncle Sam, with a canny view to the sale of sedative
Tales, uninterrupted by blockades. B’rer Crockett
also loves the Americans. So does Sarah Grand.
So would Screed and Beau Brummell Mansfield,

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> The way to get rich is to sell paper, not like the
newspaper publisher, who sometimes makes a hit
buying tree paper at two cents a pound and selling it
at the rate of one hundred fakes for five cents; that’s
an uncertain business and requires a disciplined conscience,
not to speak of capital, which is more rare.
No, sell paper of the kind recommended by the
Bucyrus <i>Authors’ Journal</i> or the Dutch Flats <i>Cable
Railway to Parnassus</i>. Here is the whole snap:</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> Mr. Sothern makes an announcement. For production
next year he has accepted <i>An Enemy to the
King</i>, and thus tosses into the arena Mr. R. N.
Stephens, of Philadelphia, who made the play. Mr.
Stephens has a past. Having endured for some
years as a dramatic editor the honeyed wheedlings of
theatrical advance agents, he crouched for a spring
last year while painstaking audiences beheld his dramatic
works, <i>The White Rat</i>, <i>The Sidewalks of New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span>
York</i>, <i>Girl Wanted</i> and others, and then he began
working out swift and cosmopolitan vengeance as an
agent on all the remaining dramatic editors. One
afternoon before that, however, Mr. George Marion,
the veteran though happy stage director for Messrs.
Davis and Keogh, contractors, sat in their Herald
Square Factory smoking the most dynamic cigar ever
taxed.</p>

<p>“What are you doing, George?” piped a voice.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not very busy,” replied Mr. Marion,
apprehensively.</p>

<p>“Well, you go over to Pittsburg and tell John
Kernell we’ll have a new play ready for him tomorrow;”
and turning around, the voice, though twisted,
remarked, “Stevens, you write Kernell a play and
send it to him tonight. Call it <i>The Irish Alderman</i>.”</p>

<p>Mr. Stephens has written eighty plays in a single
week. His nights he spends with Sherlock Holmes,
and in his dreams he converses with the White Robed
Mahatmas. His brain food is scrapple, and he draws
his strength from Johann Malt’s street car poster.
Mr. Sothern’s courage must proceed from the gods.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> Mr. Daniel Frohman, the theatrical manager, to
distinguish himself from whom Mr. Charles Frohman
bills his name with an emphatic score under the
“Charles,” has achieved for the drama something<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
dignified enough to be called an episode. He saw
what Mr. Beerbohm Tree, Mr. George Alexander, Mr.
Richard Mansfield and others denied—that Mr.
Anthony Hope’s novel, <i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i>,
needed very little mending to make a play of the
first class. For this lonely act Mr. Frohman richly
deserves a monument in Fourth avenue opposite his
templar Lyceum. A Daniel certainly came to judgment.
<i>Zenda</i> on the stage is great. Mr. Edward
Rose, who made the play, has not attempted to clear
up the moats and castles and bridges, which in an
infantry novel I never could understand, but he has
made very human beings and used a precious lot of
Mr. Hope’s dialogue. <i>Zenda</i> has a bad ending.
There is no question about that. I can just imagine
my friend, Mr. Adv. W. Bok, sitting through the
martyr separation of Rassendyll and Flavia and
scuffling away thinking “Ugh, how mean!” People
that croak over Mercutio’s untimely taking off are of
the same ilk; and they wish <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>
ended happily. Mean, are these nobilities. Rupert
in the play, scornful-merry, thinks it is the meanest
ending possible; and chained he goes laughing away,
taunting Rassendyll with being the biggest of fools
for giving up love and a kingdom for honor’s sake.
Fritz thinks not, though. Manfully he strides up to
Rassendyll, a great chunk of grief on his palate, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
taking the unwounded hand, shakes it fiercely and
silently, as if his allegiance were bound with that
clasp, and when he let go he would be a traitor forever.
And when he goes away, old Sapt comes;
and he thinks not, like Fritz. He grips the “lad’s”
hand while a tear falls on the bloody bandage Rassendyll
wears, and a magnet somewhere somehow
snaps his loyal old knee to the floor in reverence for
this “lad” that ought to be king if he isn’t. Flavia?
She thinks not, too. She is not to die, like Camille,
but is doomed to a more horrible tragedy: she must
live on. She speaks the brave, spirit-crushing word
that decrees the parting, and Rassendyll goes away,
too. The red badge of courage is on his rag-slung
arm, and there is a royal Vestal flame in his agonizing
heart. “Is love the only thing?” The tear-blinded
eyes of many a spectator of Mr. Sothern and
Miss Kimball’s sweet and pathetic performance testify
that the average man or woman thinks, yes. I
don’t know.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> In a late number of the Paris edition of the New
York <i>Herald</i> I find this: “According to the new
etymology a Philistine is one who believes in health,
good cheer and manly self reliance as opposed to
languid, mawkish sentimentality—that sure breeder
of refined vice and degeneracy.” I really could not
put the matter better than this myself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> My, My, My! but the “Note” that took the
Five Dollar Prize was rotten!</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> In the American reprint of “Without Prejudice”
sixty errors occur; the proof reading was left to Miss
Mayme, who came up from the bindery: the Only

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> My correspondents still continue to chew about
the statement that this world is Hell and we are now
being punished for sins committed in a former life.
One woman writes me that if this world is surely
Hell then there must be many devils here. “This
being so, who are they?” she asks. I can only
answer this in the words of a great poet who on
being asked who the Decadents were, replied testily:
“The others—always the others.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> The reason that it is called “Children’s Department”
is because it is conducted by papa’s little boy.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> I call the attention of Gunner Antonio Kumstalk
to the fact that while the <i>Youth’s Companion</i> and
the <i>Ladies’ Boklet</i> furnish the pictures for Art and
Underwear, the Boston <i>Commonwealth</i> still supplies

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> Law is now being successfully taught by correspondence.
In fact the most brilliant legal lights
of the future will probably be men who never went to
school a day in their lives—simply hit the principles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
of Blackstone by correspondence while working on
a farm. Journalism, too, is taught by correspondence
and also in night schools. Twenty first-class
lessons can be had for five dollars, with promise of
position as Managing Editor to all who run the
course and are glorified—that is graduated.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> I am informed that the reason young Mr. Bumball
of Chicago is often spoken of by his father as Issachar
is fully explained in verse 14 of Chapter xlix of
Genesis.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> My good friend Walter Hippeau Merriam writes
me from New York: “As a Philistine in good standing,
with dues paid to 1901, I wish to exert my prerogative
to protest. In your February issue you
allow Mr. Macpherson Wiltbank to put forth some
very startling “facts” concerning a musician named
Chopin. The musician was not fertile enough in
matters of revenge to ever originate that story of <i>The
Little White Black Bird</i>. It was the work of an
obscure poet named De Musset and can be found in
his <i>Contes</i>, (Charpentier Librarie Editeur, 39 Rue de
l’Universite, Paris, 1854.) If the Datary has not
fined Mr. Wiltbank twenty-five skekels for trifling
with truth, please see that it is done at once.”</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> The <i>New Cycle</i> has changed its name. Being
essentially feminine, and this being leap year beside,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
of course it had a perfect right to do so. The move
I understand was made to circumvent the joker who
had a way of saying <i>Wheels</i>. Neith Boyce did not
like this, for she said it was twitting on facts. She
even threatened to resign if the name was not
changed and a prettier cover used. The manager
swore he would never be dictated by a woman, and
swearing he would never consent, consented—changing
the name (but not its nature) and getting
that pretty cover. Phosphorus in editorial rooms is
at a premium, and <i>The Lotos</i> (that’s the new name)
cannot afford to lose Neith Boyce.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> <i>The Cosmopolitan</i> (not the magazine composed
merely of printers’ ink) contains on page 425 of its
February, 1896, issue a poem (?) by one Gustav
Kobbe, entitled <i>Obediah Folger</i>. In <i>Hundred Choice
Selections</i>, 1872, No. 5, under the title <i>The Nantucket
Skipper</i>, and in <i>American Union Speaker</i>,
1865, as <i>The Alarmed Skipper</i>, is the identical
story now published by John Brisben Walker as
something new! Nothing about it is new except
the word combinations. The only possible excuse
that I can see is that both the plagiarist-author and
his publisher have never been in Boston and never
heard of that eminent author and publisher, James T.
Fields, (1817-1881), who composed the first poem
on this idea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> It was well enough for Shakespeare to ask
“What’s in a name?” seeing that he never realized
what his own would stand for in the scroll of time;
but do our modern writers who are not satisfied with
one, but insist on forcing three and sometimes more
names apiece upon public observation, take the same
modest view of the significance of a cognomen? Not
when there are three or more together, evidently.
In short, and let us remember that “brevity is the
soul of wit,” the natural inference is that they hold
their signature as of more consequence than the
screed that follows it. And perhaps they are right in
this, though in some cases that is only a left-handed
compliment.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> The Revolutionary condition of Literature in America:
Old Men sitting in shade on door steps; sometime
smoking, always talking: of paper battles won
in many magazines; of thrusts with pen; parries with
pencil; ink bespattered veterans o’ercome, all in
wordy warfare; of merry meetings turned to stern
alarums; a so-long manuscript at so-much a page.
Then Boys come by detached from Philistinic Hosts:
make mud balls; revile; jeer; hiding behind bibelots.
These two Factions, the Old and Young; the Senile
and the Callow, the Wornout and the Willing: this
is all there is to Literature in America. So saith that
paper which with rare satire calls itself <i>Truth</i>.</p>

sense, the stories of “Octave Thanet” come out of
the West like young Lochinvar. Recently from
Miss French came a note of commendation enclosing

aim of all the periodicals may be? At any rate I
wish them all success, and hope they may “try to do
which,” as the French say, “is that which it is that
which it is what.” High aims are good things, we
are told, and doubtless, like the mariners, we should
steer our courses by the stars. Still there is good
game which lies close to the earth if we knew how to
hunt for it—and there’s the fun of hunting anyway,
game or not.</p>

<p><img class="inline" src="images/deco3.jpg" alt=""> Colonel Frank L. Stanton, able poet, of Atlanta,

<p class="noindent">that weekly illustrated paper published in Philadelphia,
(pity, isn’t it?) is a clean (moderately so)
paper, chock full of such uninteresting topics as interviews
with actor and actress (bless ’em); book gossip,
news from Paris and London, (dear, old Lunnon),
woman’s chatter, verse and lots more of idiocy that
only spoils white paper. It sells for five cents a copy,
or $2.00 a year. It has a big circulation (and that’s
no joke) and to make that circulation bigger yet we
will mail you the paper for the cost of postage—52
cents for 52 numbers for 52 weeks. Send the 52 any

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
